## What is Cypher Network
Cypher is the testnet network for the team and community to first and foremost find critical bugs, run tests and experiments in a Tangram-like environment.  You are now part of a huge milestone and something very special to the team and community members.

Cypher Network will be used as an early testing ground for things like consensus (messages, states and broadcasting) and gossip protocol (dissemination of members - membership).  Have fun on Cypher and learn more about Tangram!  Explore the open-source code, setup your node, and explore the features. The objective here is to get to a point where Cypher will mimic the eventual live environment of the Tangram network.  Things may get messy, this is expected.  From installation on the user’s end to protocol enhancements and feature add-ons to Cypher, things will progressively get better over time.

**Security warning**: Cypher is the first release with consensus and should be treated as an experiment!  There are no guarantees and we can expect flaws.
