## What is Cypher (Testnet V2.0 release)?
Cypher is a testnet network for the team and community to first and foremost find critical bugs, run tests and experiments in a Tangram-like environment. If you’re apart of this release, you’re apart of a huge milestone and something very special to the team and community members.

Cypher test-net1 will be used as an early proving ground for things like consensus (messages, states and broadcasting), gossip protocol (dissemination of members - membership).

Have fun on Cypher and learn more about Tangram! Explore the open-source code, setup your node, and explore the features. The objective here is to get to a point where Cypher will mimic the eventual live environment of Tangram network. Things may get messy, this is expected, this will progressively get better over-time. From installation on the user’s end to protocol enhancements and feature add-ons to Cypher.

**Security warning**: Cypher is the first release with consensus and then some and should be treated as an experiment! There are no guarantees and expect major flaws.

## Who can participate in Cypher?
If you wish to run a node, experiment and support the release by finding bugs or even getting yourself accustomed to the intricacies of what Tangram is about, this is release is for you! This is the perfect time to start getting to know Tangram and the inner mechanics of its technologies and protocols.

If you wish to participate in the release of Cypher, you can claim $CYP through any of the channels (we recommend Discord, [**here**](https://discord.gg/w4t8hqg).
